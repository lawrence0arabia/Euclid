# Euclid
Super simple Euclidean algorithm solver to find the greatest common denominator, with steps so you can pretend you did it by hand.

"a" is the first number, "b" is the second number. It literally couldn't be simpler.

If you wanna find the gcd of 3 numbers just run it again with the output from the last one, since gcd(a,b,c) = gcd((a,b),c)

I might update this in future so you can do the extended euclidean algorithm as well, but for now it does the trick.
